/* ━━━━━━━━━━━━ The Layout's own name and logo ━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Valero runs on its own address of the shop molino (one shop, a Layout
   per domain), so the shop's own title would put "molino" in its header,
   footer, page titles and every line that names the shop. The owner asked
   for Valero's own name and logo (7 November 2026): the title is
   replaced here, as soon as the shop is read, for this Layout only. The shop
   record on Selldone (its emails, dashboard, the SEO page Selldone serves to
   crawlers) keeps "molino".

   The mark (assets/brand/valero-mark.svg, 64x64 SVG) stands before the wordmark in
   the header and footer and is the browser tab's icon. */
